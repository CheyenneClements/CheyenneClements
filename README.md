## Hi there 👋🏻 I'm Cheyenne

An HR professional turned Data Analyst, I’m passionate about using data to uncover insights that help businesses solve problems and grow. I love being creative and strategic when approaching data and  enjoy exploring data to identify patterns, tell meaningful stories, and support better decision-making.

I’m excited to continue developing clever, data-driven solutions. 

Welcome to my GitHub — where creativity meets problem-solving through data!
